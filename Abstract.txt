Viola-Jones algorithm is an object recognition framework that allows the detection of human faces. Viola-Jones algorithm is robust, powerful, and faster despite being outdated.
The Viola-Jones algorithm first detects the face on the grayscale image and then finds the location on the colored image.
With smaller steps, a number of boxes detect face-like features (Haar-like features) and the data of all of those boxes put together, helps the algorithm determine where the face is.

Viola-Jones Algorithm: There are different types of algorithm used in face detection.Here, we have used Viola-Jones Algorithm for face detection using MATLAB program.
This algorithm works in following steps:
1. Creates a detector object using Viola-Jones Algorithm.
2. Takes the image from the video.
3. Detects features.
4. Annotates the detected features.
