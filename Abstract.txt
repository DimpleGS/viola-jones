Viola-Jones Algorithm: There are different types of algorithm used in face detection.
Here, we have used Viola-Jones Algorithm for face detection using MATLAB program.
This algorithm works in following steps:
1. Creates a detector object using Viola-Jones Algorithm.
2. Takes the image from the video.
3. Detects features.
4. Annotates the detected features.
